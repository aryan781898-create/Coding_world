➡️#👉 MY FIRST PROJECT 👈#⬅️

#Basic calculator :

a = int(input("enter a first digit:" ))
b = int(input("enter second digit:" ))

#This calculator that can performs (addition , subtraction , miltiplication and division):
    
print("addition:" , a+b)
print("subtraction:" , a-b)
print("multiplication:" , a*b)
print("division:" , a/b)
print("a to the power:" , a**0.5)

# this my first project as a begginer:



➡️#👉 MY SECOND PROJECT 👈#⬅️


# I made a program that can perform table:
# write table of (n)using [while and for loops]:

#first we write program using (while loop) , we will make table of n using (while loop):
    
#first of all we take input from the user:
    
i = 1
n = int(input("enter num:" ))

while i <= 10:
    print(i*n)
    i+=1
    
# this code give us to table of n:

for i in range(1,11):
    
    print(i*n)

👉#➡️ MY FOURTH PROJECT ⬅️ #👈


#this is program that can perform sum of (n) number:
    
#while loop:
    
n = int(input("enter num:" ))
i = 0
total = 0
while i <= n:
     total+=i
     i+=1
print("sum:" , total)

#this program give us sum of input numbers:
